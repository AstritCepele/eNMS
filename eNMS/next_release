- Table performance improved (x200)

- Refactoring of the result window

- Refactoring of the search system

- Forbid single and double-quotes in names.

- Rename migration files lowercase

- Change custom service lowercase PEP8

- Update migration files:

type: Device -> type: device etc...
job -> service
Job -> Service
ExampleService -> example_service
DatabaseBackupService -> database_backup_service
NapalmBackupService -> napalm_backup_service
NetmikoBackupService -> netmiko_backup_service
NapalmConfigurationService -> napalm_configuration_service
NapalmRollbackService -> napalm_rollback_service
NetmikoConfigurationService -> netmiko_configuration_service
NapalmGettersService -> napalm_getters_service
NetmikoPromptsService -> netmiko_prompts_service
NetmikoValidationService -> netmiko_validation_service
ConfigureBgpService -> configure_bgp_service
GenericFileTransferService -> generic_file_transfer_service
NetmikoFileTransferService -> netmiko_file_transfer_service
AnsiblePlaybookService -> ansible_playbook_service
RestCallService -> rest_call_service
SwissArmyKnifeService -> swiss_army_knife_service
UpdateInventoryService -> update_inventory_service
NapalmPingService -> napalm_ping_service
NapalmTracerouteService -> napalm_traceroute_service
PingService -> ping_service
MailNotificationService -> mail_notification_service
SlackNotificationService -> slack_notification_service
MattermostNotificationService -> mattermost_notification_service
UnixCommandService -> unix_command_service
UnixShellScriptService -> unix_shell_script_service
PayloadExtractionService -> payload_extraction_service
PayloadValidationService -> payload_validation_service
PythonSnippetService -> python_snippet_service

All workflows must now be in the service.yaml file.

Renaming: python_query -> device_query
query_property_type -> device_query_property
skip_python_query -> skip_query
workflow_device -> parent_device (because iteration targets work for a service too)

In the migration file:
device_query -> iteration_devices
query_property_type -> iteration_devices_property

- Moved the validation mechanism to the base "Service" class. Validation is now 
available for all services.

- New "Close cached connection" in a workflow. True by default.
Will close all cached connections when the workflow is done.
Can be deactivated

- the database package for MySQL and PostgreSQL are no longer part of "requirements.txt".
They are in "requirements_db.txt" instead.
The reason is that they can make the pip installation fail depending on the environment, and 
this can be hard to troubleshoot for new users.

- In the "Advanced search", new "None" entry for filtering relationship.
When you want to display all services that do not belong to any workflow, you would previously
select all workflow and "Not related to Any".
For scalability purpose, "Select all" has now been removed so doing that is no longer 
an option. Instead, I added "None": it will do the same thing without you having to select
anything.

- Removed mypy from both the codebase and CI/CD test (travis).

- Refactoring of the configuration management system.

- Refactoring of the workflow system

- You can now specify the alignment for workflow labels

- Workflow backend refactoring:
* remove "Use Workflow Devices" property.
* remove mode traversal property.
* rename "job" -> "service"
* change "run_job" to "run_service"
* credentials are no longer available for all services, only when it's useful in specific section

- "skip query" now lets you specify a device.

- Upon creating the admin user, check if there is a password in the Vault.
If there isn't, create it ("admin").
