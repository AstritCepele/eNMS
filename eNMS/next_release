- Fix Ansible AJAX bug: form not properly populated.
- Ansible playbooks are now alphabetically sorted.
- New JSON field for REST payload: now accept any valid JSON object, including list.
- Netmiko command length now up to 2 ** 15 characters long
- New netmiko option for netmiko validation service
1. Label: Optional End-of-output regex:   New Textbox in the Netmiko Parameters group
2. Auto Find Prompt - checkbox (pass to send_command() as auto_find_prompt) - should default to True
3. Strip Prompt - checkbox (pass to send_command() as strip_prompt) - should default to True
4. Strip Command - checkbox (pass to send_command() as strip_command) - should default to True
- Added missing has_targets for the Ansible service
- New Ansible service error: if has_targets is NOT selected, but pass_device_properties IS selected,
then a RED alert box indicates that "pass device properties requires has device targets to be selected".
- Ansible service no longer passes the device configuration when "pass device properties" is ticked
- Changed ansible command syntax when pass device properties is ticked:
BEFORE:
ansible-playbook -e {<json stuff>} -i ip_address,  /path/to/playbook.yml
NOW:
ansible-playbook -e '{<json stuff>}' -i ip_address, /path/to/playbook.yml
- Store coordinates as string instead of float (MySQL rounding issues)
- fix REST API query bug
