* ENMS_SERVER_ADDR -> SERVER_ADDR
* ENMS_DATABASE_URL -> DATABASE_URL
* ENMS_SECRET_KEY -> SECRET_KEY

- Rename controller -> app

- Rename "Payload version" -> Restart runtime

- Make restart system work with get_result

- Re-add "Workflow Restartability" window when clicking on a job.

- Forbid empty names and names with slash front-end

- Fix event issue after adding jobs to the workflow builder.

- Create and delete iteration loopback edge upon editing the service.

- Fix change of name in workflow builder upon editing the service.

- RENAME iteration_targets -> iteration_values

- Make iteration variable name configurable

- Ansible add exit status:
EXIT STATUS -----------
0 -- OK or no hosts matched
1 -- Error
2 -- One or more hosts failed
3 -- One or more hosts were unreachable
4 -- Parser error
5 -- Bad or incomplete options
99 -- User interrupted execution
250 -- Unexpected error

- Bug: if two people are watching the same workflow run in WF builder and one person moves a
job position on the display, when the other users page refreshes they lose the current payload.
>>> Fixed.

Workflow notes Desc: Support textboxes added to a workflow that are displayed in the workflow builder.
Note: This might be documentation of the overall workflow (or caveats), or might be notes specific to a step.
Note positions should be maintained like service/workflow positions. Priority: 3
>>> Done.

- RestCallService 404 as success Desc: Provide an option to accept 404 as success
Note: Unmount requests to the BNC return 404 if the device is not already mounted.
From the service perspective, this is still success. Priority: 2 
New mechanism: success as a python query kind of thingAdd success query mechanism

- The "has device targets" property now defaults to True.

- Implement a mechanism to switch back and forth in the workflow builder.

- Add new "Latest runtime" optio in workflow builder (this is the default option).
When displaying a workflow, automatically jump to the latest runtime.

- In Workflow builder, add the name of the user who ran the runtime in the runtime list.

- Display number of runs in parallel in the Service Management / Workflow Management page, next to the Status (Running / Idle)

- Display a job in grey if skip job is activated.

- Make edge label editable

- Add workflow property in general section

- Change of property: Use workflow devices and "workflow traversal mode" (service by service or device by device)
device_targets_mode -> use_workflow_devices / workflow_traversal_mode
MIGRATION:
device_targets_mode: service -> use_workflow_devices: true / workflow_traversal_mode: service
device_targets_mode: device -> use_workflow_devices: true / workflow_traversal_mode: device
device_targets_mode: ignore -> use_workflow_devices: false / workflow_traversal_mode: service

- List of string transformation for JSON display: don't do it when the type of display is TEXT
>>> In text mode, multiline strings are now displayed  without any transformation.
In text mode multilines strings are now displayed without any transformation.

- Workflow shape: ellipse by default.

- Separate automation and execution:
from eNMS.models.automation import Run, Service
 |
from eNMS.models.automation import Service
from eNMS.models.execution import Run

- To reduce load between the browser and the server, monitor for user inactivity, and if determined,
cease all Ajax activity until activity resumes.
>>> Done.

- add end runtime for a device results (right now, onlin runtime in the results)
>>> Done.

- remove positions from jobs results + REST API
>>> Done.

- different display and color for workflows
Workflows are now displayed with an ellipse.

- When SAVING without a NAME it's not obvious that the name is missing
>>> Fixed.

- For logs like this, is it possible to print the source IP of the browser that this traffic is going to?

>>> Done.

- actual priv mode should match the service requested mode for each service,
independent of actions by the previous service.
>>> Done.

Variables are accessed with get_var. The value shouldn't just be shoved into the top-level
of the payload, it should be: get_var("iter_var", device=device.name)
>>> Done, now the iteration variable is retrieved with get_var, WITHOUT DEVICE:
get_var("iteration_value")

- Two people watching the same runtime of the same workflow.
If one of them moves a job, the runtime is lost in the second window.
>>> Fixed.

- Add the ability to define a group that is minimized by default in the GUI.
>>> Done.

- Redirect to login page on a 403
>>> Done.

- Params / Headers are now JSON field, just like the payload field.

- Abort feature.
