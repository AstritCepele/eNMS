- Iteration Service (missing: GUI ?)
- Connection Cache
- Services now have access to an additional parameter via their job function: "parent"
Parent is the workflow if the service runs within a workflow, and the service when the service runs as part of an iteration service.
- Payload Extraction Service (both text/dict, regex and YaQL)
- Task scheduling via REST API
- Task targets and payload to override the scheduled jobs'
- /!\ Custom services now receive an additional "parent" parameter. If the service runs within a workflow, this parent will be the workflow.
- - PRIORITY: split string and dict validation: done. You now have a dedicated string validation form.
- added a bunch of useful endpoints to the rest api: "update_database_configurations_from_git", "update_all_pools", "get_git_content"
