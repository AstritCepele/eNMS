- New env variable: CUSTOM_CODE_PATH. Lets you define a path to a folder that contains custom code that 
you can use in your custom services.

- Advanced search: per relationship system

- eNMS version is now displayed in the UI. The version number is read from the package.json file.

- Refactoring of the results:
Ideally, the results window for a service/workflow should let you browse the results not only per runtime,
but also devices
>>> Done.

- Also at times, a workflow user wants to see the services run for a device,
>>> Done.

and at other times wants to see all devices run for a service.
>>> Done.

1. View by device: In order list of services run on a specific device
>>> Done.

a. Collapsable sections: Moving around in the data is overwhelming. 
>>> Done.

- Refactoring of the logs. One logger per service in "logs" folder. Real-time logs is now working
even with multiprocessing enabled.
NGINX CONF: proxy buffering MUST BE DISABLED. (eg

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
)

- Workflow restartability
>>> I improved the workflow restartability system:
- you can still select a version of the payload
- you can now choose exactly what jobs you want to see included in that payload
- you can select not just one but multiple start points for the workflow

- make custom credentials blue / substitution fields
>>> Done.

- One minor change would be helpful: The dropdown with previous payloads defaults to the oldest payload.
Can you make it default to the latest payload instead, that's almost always what a user would choose.
>>> Done.

- Bug in tables: jump to bottom after page 1 when table is refreshed: fixed.

- Panel repaint bug when pulling it down: fixed.

- Relationship are now displayed in the edit window: you can edit which service/workflow a device/task is a target of, etc...

- I added a pool using a regex that had 2 negative lookahead.
I pressed the SAVE button and it basically acted unresponsive (but was in fact running to calculate
the pool).  After about 10 seconds, I pressed the SAVE button again, and then I saw 2 green alert
boxes saying that my Pool was created.   It looks like only 1 pool got created, but this needs a
more immediate response. Perhaps this is the time to put in that spinning GIF that Marc likes to
indicate that its 'working...'
>>> Done.

- spread service in a startsteps in the workflow builder.
>>> Done.

- In the workflow builder, double clicking on a service puts it into Move mode.
It seems more natural to edit the service when it's double clicked.  What do you think?
>>> Done.

- Bug fixes
