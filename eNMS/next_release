- Always delete a workflow when it is imported via import job

- New "Maximum number of runs" property for a job in a workflow: defines how many times the same
job is allowed to run in the workflow.
Set to 1 by default (=> backward-compatible).

- New "Result postprocessing" feature: allows for postprocessing the results of a service
(per device if there are devices), including changing the success value.
However, the validation part still takes place BEFORE the postprocessing of the results.

- Add new version of Unix Shell Script service

- Enable multiple selection in the workflow builder + mass skip / unskip buttons
Two ways for multiple selection:
* Ctrl + Click on jobs
* Press Right-click and move the mouse to draw a rectangle: all jobs inside the rectangle will be selected.

- Set the configuration management workflow to "Use workflow devices": false by default.

MIGRATION:
Custom success value changed from eval syntax to exec syntax.
