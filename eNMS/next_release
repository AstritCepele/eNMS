- Improve the Iteration Service: support for conversion to targets
- add more substitution field netmiko services
Netmiko Validation - expect string
Netmiko Prompts - All of the ConfirmationX and ResponseX fields
- New option for database engine creation: pool_recycle set to 3600
to fix MySQL db has gone away bug
- Generic file transfer fix
- Exported jobs not updated (cached).
Now done front-end: should be updated every time you reopen the window.
- password field in rest call: no clear-text password on screen anymore
- YaQL query bug device not found
Temporary fix: if a device is not found it is silently ignored instead of making the service fail.
Let's perhaps discuss, once you've pulled the new changes, if it is still needed to be able to define
the service targets at service level versus using an iteration service.
- fix multiprocessing bug.
- refactoring of the workflow system to allow substitution in YaQL query when use workflow targets in enabled.
- Improve Netmiko Prompt so that it fails if confirmation not in result.
