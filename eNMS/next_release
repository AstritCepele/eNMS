- In Netmiko Prompts, we are not handling the cases where confirmation1,2,3 exists(is provided by user),
but is not received in the response1,2,3, then in that case, the result/service should fail...
- New Netmiko Multiline Service where the validation is a simple single line text.
The user could only use it to chain very simple commands where no complicated logic could be used
parse response. In this way it would look like the prompt service and keep the form fairly simple.
- Rename YaQL query label, make yaql query a substitution field.
- Remove "define devices from payload" tickbox: if YaQL query is not empty, it will be
used to select the job's targets.
- When creating a new object, error if there already is an instance with the same name.
- Fix dictionary match mechanism (recursive function not returning result)
- Pausing an Active Task throws an exception > fixed
- Connection cache: - Need to handle OSError as well as Value Error exception.
- rest call service URL length + headers/param + dict match large fields
- when creating a service, creator is always set to admin
- services cannot be filtered per OS/vendor
- remove devices and poools when exporting service or workflow
- compress exported workflow as tgz archive
- Using a YAQL query to pull devices results in the stacktrace below if the service name is incorrect,
and leaves the workflow in a running state.
>>> Fixed, now if one of the derived targets does not exist, the base target will fail.
It collects the names of all invalid devices, not just the first.
