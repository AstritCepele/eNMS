- Extend the custom property definition for services to allow grouping such that a dropdown is displayed
with each group name, and only properties for the selected group are visible.
As we add new validation types, the custom page is getting long and confusing.
Some mechanism is needed to reduce the clutter. A secondary goal is to prevent invalid combinations
from being defined, but that's a more complex problem.
>>> Done.

- Initial Payload: now available from the UI for services and workflows.

- Substitution field now have a specific color to let you know it supports substitution.

- could you add a dialog box to select which jobs in the exported_jobs folder to import?
>>> Done.

- Service Management could benefit from having a reverse lookup field or button:
"Show me all of the workflows that this service instance participates in" ...
similar to the 'Automation' button for devices.
Ability to display the workflows for a service instance and sort by same.
>>> This is done, but not exactly like the "Automation button" for devices, because the purpose is not the same.
The automation button for devices lets you remove devices from one or more pools.
However, there is no need to remove a service instance from one or more workflow
(this is something you'd do from the workflow builder instead, where you see what the service is doing).
Instead, I'm using this "Advanced Search" filtering to implement this feature.
Just like you can filter devices and links per pool, you can now filter services per workflow (show all services that belong to a workflow)
and filter workflows per service (show all workflows that contain this service).

- Bug fixes.
