- the database package for MySQL and PostgreSQL are no longer part of "requirements.txt".
They are in "requirements_db.txt" instead.
The reason is that they can make the pip installation fail depending on the environment, and 
this can be hard to troubleshoot for new users.

- In the "Advanced search", new "None" entry for filtering relationship.
When you want to display all services that do not belong to any workflow, you would previously
select all workflow and "Not related to Any".
For scalability purpose, "Select all" has now been removed so doing that is no longer 
an option. Instead, I added "None": it will do the same thing without you having to select
anything.

- Removed mypy from both the codebase and CI/CD test (travis).

- Refactoring of the configuration management system.

- Refactoring of the workflow system

- You can now specify the alignment for workflow labels

- Workflow backend refactoring:
* remove "Use Workflow Devices" property.
* remove mode traversal property.
* rename "job" -> "service"
* change "run_job" to "run_service"
