- Always delete a workflow when it is imported via import job
- New "Maximum number of runs" property for a job in a workflow: defines how many times the same
job is allowed to run in the workflow.
- New "Result postprocessing" feature: allows for postprocessing the results of a service
(per device if there are devices), including changing the success value.
However, the validation part still takes place BEFORE the postprocessing of the results.
