- In Netmiko Prompts, we are not handling the cases where confirmation1,2,3 exists(is provided by user),
but is not received in the response1,2,3, then in that case, the result/service should fail...
- New Netmiko Multiline Service where the validation is a simple single line text.
The user could only use it to chain very simple commands where no complicated logic could be used
parse response. In this way it would look like the prompt service and keep the form fairly simple.

- Remove "define devices from payload" tickbox: if YaQL query is not empty, it will be
used to select the job's targets.

- Fix dictionary match mechanism (recursive function not returning result)
- Pausing an Active Task throws an exception > fixed
