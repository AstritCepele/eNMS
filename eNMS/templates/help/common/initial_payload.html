        The <b>initial_payload</b> parameter provides a starting data that can be
        referenced later by service(s). This parameter is a dictionary with key/value
        pairs. This parameter is always present and will default to "<b>{ }</b>".
      </p>
      <p>
        Important note: only one <b>initial_payload</b> matters - the one selected on the
        service or workflow being run. Inside of a workflow, an
        <b>initial_payload</b> defined on a service that is part of that workflow will
        have no effect when running the enclosing workflow.

      Alternatives to using <b>initial_payload</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In some cases, using a REST Service to lookup values can offers some design
          advantages.
