What is eNMS
============

eNMS is a vendor-agnostic NMS designed for building workflow-based network automation solutions.

It encompasses the following aspects of network automation:
  - **Configuration Management Service**: Backup, change and rollback of configurations (saved in git).
  - **Validation Services**: Retrieve data about the state of a device with Netmiko and NAPALM.
  - **Ansible Service**: Store and run Ansible playbooks.
  - **REST Service**: Send REST calls with variable URL and payload.
  - **Python Script Service**: Any python script can be integrated into the web UI. eNMS will automatically generate
a form in the web UI for the script input parameters.
  - **Workflows**: Services can be combined together graphically in a workflow.
  - **Scheduling**: Services and workflows can be scheduled to start at a later time, or run periodically with CRON.
  - **Event-driven automation**: Services and workflows can be triggered by an external event (REST call, Syslog message, etc).

Main features
-------------
    
Creation of the network
***********************

Your network topology can be created manually (from the UI or an Excel spreadsheet) or imported from an
external Source of Truth (OpenNMS, LibreNMS, Netbox).
Once created, it is are displayed in a sortable and searchable table.
A dashboard provides a graphical overview of your network with dynamic charts.

Network visualization
*********************

Once created, eNMS can display your network on a world map with either the Google Map
or the Open Street Map tile layers. Each device is displayed on the map at its GPS coordinates.
Colocated devices can be grouped into geographical sites (campus, dacacenter, ...),
and displayed logically with a force-directed layout.
You can click on a device to display its properties or start a Web SSH terminal session.

Workflows
*********

Services (and other Workflows) can be combined into a single workflow.
Within a workflow, services can be connected with two edge types: `Success` edge and `Failure` edge. The `Success` edge (versus `Failure` edge) indicates which path to follow in the graph if the source service is successfully executed (versus failed).
A workflow keeps track of a `payload` dictionary, such that when a service starts, it has access to the results of all previously executed services.
When a workflow is executed, its status will be updated in real-time on the web UI.

Scheduling
**********

While services and workflows can be run directly and immediately from the web UI, you can also schedule them to run at a later time, or periodically by defining a frequency, a start date and an end date. All scheduled tasks are displayed in a calendar.

Configuration Management
************************

eNMS can work as a network device configuration backup tool and replace Oxidized/Rancid with the following features:
  - Poll network elements; download configurations when they change
  - Easily view the current configuration of a device in the inventory
  - Search for any text in any configuration
  - View differences between various revisions of a configuration
  - Download device configuration to a local text file
  - Use the ReST API support to return a specified deviceâ€™s configuration
  - Export all device configurations to a remote Git repository (e.g. Gitlab)

Event-driven automation
***********************

Event-driven automation in eNMS has two aspects:
  - eNMS has a ReST API that can be used to create, update and delete any type of objects (services, workflows, tasks), but also to trigger the execution of a service or a workflow. 
  - eNMS can be configured as a Syslog server: all logs are stored in the database, and rules can be created to trigger the execution of a service or a workflow upon receiving a log matched by the rule.

Application stack
-----------------

eNMS is built on the :guilabel:`Flask` Python framework and utilizes either a :guilabel:`SQLite`, :guilabel:`MySQL`, or a :guilabel:`PostgreSQL` database. It runs as a WSGI service behind your choice of HTTP server.
