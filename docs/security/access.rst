Role-based access
=================

When you create a new user from the :guilabel:`schedule/task_management`, you get to specify what the user can and cannot do.

There are two types of access-rights:
    - Access a section (`Automation Section`, `Views Section`, etc). If a user doesn't have the `Automation Section` right, the `Automation` tab will not appear in the menu.
    - Editing (`Edit Automation Section`, `Edit Scheduling Section`, etc). If a user doesn't have the editing right for a given section, he won't be able to create, edit or delete any object from that section.

The `Admin` right grants access to everything: it is equivalent to selecting everything.
